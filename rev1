My first review will be over https://github.com/smileyplace/Project2. 
In Andys read.me file I saw a lot of valuable information and very detailed information. I like the fact that he worked through vi even though through nano would 
have been easier to follow and process throught the instructions you provided us with. Every file uploaded was extremely detailed to where I could read the following text
and be able to process the information in my own interpretation. Being able to provide detailed information over a project ensures the person working on the project has
a good understanding of what they are working on and reading Andy's read.me file that is what I though of.
